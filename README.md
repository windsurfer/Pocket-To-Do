Similar to many other digital and analog planners, this takes the approach that a timeline is the best way to represent the day. It has minimal features, but is organized in a clear and readable way. Try it for a week.

The idea is to print out a sheet, cut it in half, and fold them in half twice. You write your weekly plans on the left pane, and your agenda on the right. The grey area marks roughly when it is dark out. 

I didn't include between 0000 and 0600 as I figured it took up too much space and isn't useful for an agenda.
